1. 컬러스페이스란?


A color space is a specific organization of colors.


In combination with color profiling supported by various physical devices, and supports reproducible representations of color -- whether such representation entails an analog or a digital representation.


A color space may be arbitrary, i.e. with physically realised colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches with corresponding assigned color names (including discrete numbers) in -- for example -- the Pantone collection), or structured with mathematical rigor (as with the NCS System, Adobe RGB and sRGB).

2. 컬러스페이스의 다양한 모델


- YUV
Digital video is often encoded in a YUV format. 


If you have worked with computer graphics, you are probably familiar with RGB color.


An RGB color is encoded using three values: red, green, and blue. 


These values correspond directly to portions of the visible spectrum. 


The three RGB values form a mathematical coordinate system, called a color space. 


The red component defines one axis of this coordinate system, blue defines the second, and green defines the third, as shown in the following illustration. 


Any valid RGB color falls somewhere within this color space. For example, pure magenta is 100% blue, 100% red, and 0% green.

- ACES Colorspace


ACES is a free and open color management system, meaning it is not tied to a specific platform or program. 


It’s designed to work with the technology of today, as well as future workflows. 


The ACES color space includes everything the human eye can see, meaning there are no restrictions or limitations of the color space.


It is not a program or workflow or “look.” ACES was designed to help you with your workflow. 


ACES consists of encoding specifications, transform definitions and guidelines, metadata definitions, standard screen specifications, and the specifications for archive-ready image data and metadata.

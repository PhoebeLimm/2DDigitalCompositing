What is LUT? Color LookUpTable ?

LUT means “Look Up Table.” It’s helpful to think of it like a math problem: R= S+L


> “R” being your result or what you want to attain.


> “S” being your source or what you start with.


> “L” being your LUT or the difference needed to make up between your source and your desired outcome.

What is LUT? Color LookUpTable ?
===============


LUT (known as Lookup Table), is a term used to describe a predetermined array of numbers that provide a shortcut for a specific computation. 


In the context of color grading, a LUT transforms color input values (camera) to your desired output values (final footage).

First of all what is a LUT and what are its typical uses?

LUT means “Look Up Table.” It’s helpful to think of it like a math problem: R= S+L


> “R” being your result or what you want to attain.


> “S” being your source or what you start with.


> “L” being your LUT or the difference needed to make up between your source and your desired outcome.



1D and 3D LUTs
-----------

There are two types of LUTs we can use in the color grading process.

1. 1D LUTs – These LUTs may be useful for setting contrast, the white point of a display, or overall color balance adjustments but they do little to convey the complexities needed for creating a good looking image when grading.


2. 3D LUTs – These LUTs overcome the limitations of 1D LUTs by placing color and luma in a 3D space, a much more representative way of how color works in real world. 3D LUTs are much more useful for capturing and relaying complex color grades than a 1D LUTs.
